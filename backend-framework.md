# Backend Framework for TurboScribe Pro

## Introduction

TurboScribe Pro is an AI-powered transcription service designed to convert audio and video files into text efficiently using OpenAI's Whisper model. The backend framework described here is built using Node.js with Express and PostgreSQL as the database. This document outlines the architecture, design principles, and implementation strategies for creating a robust, scalable, and secure backend system.

## 1. API Architecture and Endpoints Organization

### RESTful API Design Patterns

The API will follow RESTful principles, ensuring statelessness, cacheability, and a uniform interface. The endpoints will be organized to clearly reflect resources and actions.

### Endpoint Structure

- **Base URL**: `/api/v1`
  
  | Method | Endpoint                      | Description                        |
  |--------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
  | POST   | `/auth/register`              | Register a new user                |
  | POST   | `/auth/login`                 | Authenticate user and provide token|
  | POST   | `/files/upload`               | Upload audio/video files           |
  | GET    | `/transcriptions/:id`         | Fetch transcription by ID          |
  | PUT    | `/transcriptions/:id`         | Edit transcription                 |
  | GET    | `/export/:id`                 | Export transcription in chosen format |

### Naming Conventions

- Use nouns for resource names.
- Use HTTP methods to determine action types.
- Use plural nouns for collections (e.g., `/transcriptions`).

### Request/Response Formats

- **Request**: JSON format
  ```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword"
  }
  ```

- **Response**: JSON format
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
      "userId": "123",
      "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
    }
  }
  ```

### Versioning Strategy

- Use URL versioning: `/api/v1`
- Increment version for breaking changes.

### Middleware Organization

- **Authentication Middleware**: Validate JWT tokens.
- **Logging Middleware**: Log requests and responses.
- **Error Handling Middleware**: Capture and handle errors centrally.

### Route Handlers

- Separate business logic from route handlers.
- Use controllers for handling requests and services for business logic.

---

## 2. Database Schema Design

### ORM Integration

- Use Prisma for ORM.
- Define models for User, File, and Transcription.

### Connection Optimization

- Utilize connection pooling.
- Configure idle and connection timeouts.

### Transaction Management

- Use transactions for multi-step operations, ensuring atomicity.

### Query Optimization

- Index frequently queried fields.
- Use query plans to optimize complex queries.

### Migration Approach

- Use Prisma Migrate for schema changes.
- Version control migration scripts.

---

## 3. Authentication/Authorization Approach

### JWT Implementation

- Use JWT for stateless authentication.
- Store JWT in HTTP-only cookies.

### OAuth 2.0 Integration

- Plan for future integration with third-party login services.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Define roles (e.g., Admin, User) and permissions in the database.
- Implement middleware to enforce RBAC.

### Session Management

- Use JWT for session management.
- Implement refresh tokens to extend session lifespan.

### Refresh Token Strategy

- Store refresh tokens securely in the database.
- Use refresh tokens to issue new access tokens.

---

## 4. Error Handling Strategy

### Centralized Error Handling

- Implement a global error handler in Express.

### Custom Error Classes

- Define custom error classes for different error types (e.g., `ValidationError`, `AuthenticationError`).

### Logging and Monitoring

- Integrate with a logging service (e.g., Winston, Morgan).
- Use monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry).

### User-Friendly Error Responses

- Send clear, informative error messages to the client.

### Error Recovery

- Implement retry logic for transient errors.

---

## 5. Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategies

- Use Redis for caching frequent queries and session data.

### Rate Limiting

- Implement rate limiting using middleware (e.g., `express-rate-limit`).

### Database Connection Pooling

- Configure pooling to manage active connections efficiently.

### Query Optimization

- Optimize queries by reviewing execution plans.

### Horizontal Scaling

- Design the application for stateless horizontal scaling using containers.

---

## 6. Security Implementations

### Input Validation and Sanitization

- Use libraries like `express-validator` for input validation.

### CSRF Protection

- Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing requests.

### CORS Configuration

- Configure CORS to allow trusted origins only.

### SQL Injection Prevention

- Use parameterized queries with Prisma.

### XSS Protection

- Sanitize user input and use content security policies.

### Rate Limiting and Brute Force Protection

- Use rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.

### Data Encryption

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using PostgreSQL.
- Use HTTPS for data in transit.

---

## 7. Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- Use Jest for writing unit tests.

### Integration Testing

- Use Supertest for testing API endpoints.

### End-to-End Testing

- Utilize Cypress for end-to-end testing workflows.

### Mock Frameworks

- Use tools like `sinon` for mocking dependencies.

---

## 8. Deployment and DevOps

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### Environment Configuration

- Manage environment variables securely (e.g., dotenv).

### Containerization

- Use Docker for containerization.
- Define Dockerfiles for service images.

### Infrastructure as Code

- Use Terraform for managing cloud resources.
